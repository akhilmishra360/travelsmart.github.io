<p><b>Carpool tips</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the person is who they say they are from their phone number
using the following link <a href="http://www.eircomphonebook.ie">http://www.eircomphonebook.ie</a> or a similar phone book.
</li>
<li>Meet new carpool partner(s) before the first commuting morning. Sit 
down over coffee or lunch and discuss how the carpool needs to operate. 
</li>
<li>Set up a probationary period to try the arrangement. If it isn't 
working, change the rules, or get a new partner. 
</li>
<li>Establish a schedule for driving. 
</li>
<li>Discuss preferences like seating arrangements, music, news, smoking, 
eating and talking. 
</li>
<li>Be punctual. Set reasonable time limits for late members. Don't wait 
longer than the time set. 
</li>
<li>Make backup plans. 
</li>
<li>Be fair. Try to set up the most equitable arrangement possible. 
Alternate drivers, or plan for reimbursements. The average mid-sized car 
costs 12 cents per mile to operate just for petrol, oil tires and 
maintenance. 
</li>

<li>Keep communicating. Problems may arise occasionally, or situations 
change, plan ahead of time to discuss needs and make necessary changes. 
</li>
</ul>
