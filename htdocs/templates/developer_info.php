<li>Thanks a googol google for making such a fantastic base for me to work off.
Are you interested in helping me take travelsmart to the next level?
</li>
<li>
The Apple iPhone is an excellent machine powerwise except it is neutered & doesn't allow third parties develop for it aside from javascript ones, it only needs two minor fixups so that it works properly with my add_new_location.php page & also something to make the google maps scroll properly which needs ui fixes for the scrollbars on the webpage & another on the select boxes to select region & nearby location you need to be able to type into these to make selection quicker, I've over 1000 entries in some select boxes. Pressure has to be put Apple via every possible apple.com source to release the code as least as much as he did for Mac OSX, the iPhone is potentially the one laptop per child model if sold in the billions. It also needs a usb driver so you can plug in a mini usb keyboard like the model from keysonic all you need extra is a female female usb adapter. It has the power of a G3 S/390 mainframe.</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>First thing I'd like google to do is to link to their taxi service
& their route planning, then improve the teledata maps of Ireland
outside the cities.
</li>
<li>The source is when I decide to give it away will be under
a freebsd licence or GPL or my own licence.</li>
<li>
If google complain PHP is too slow engineers from IBM's or Suns just in time compiler (JIT) java teams to might make a php JIT, it already has a bytecode interpreter.
</li>
<li>All worldwide timetables for flights trains & buses & taxis
should be put into the system. Anton Wallace he already did 
something similar while working with me
in 1993 in PCSL +44 7624462110 ring him between 6 and 10pm GMT and ask
him for advice & see if you can get his C source code for this part,
a complete rewrite would need to be done to avoid licencing issues
unless you contact  Werner Gronemeyer from Munich the boss at PCSL.
</li>
<li>The dtstealer was to steal the userbase from dublintraffic.ie
the file t6 is the latest collection of people who haven't yet
joined travelsmart, keep pestering them</li>
<li>Technology merges with mitfahrgelegenheit.de carpoolworld.com
& tescos carpool website & user base merges too.
</li>
<li>
Travelsmart in Australia give me your users & you can use my software
& better logos & do a technology merge of software if you wish.
</li>
<li>
Ollie Cahill is doing a reverse auction website www.warehog.com
this technology should be added to travelsmart to bargain
for the cheapest trips.
</li>
<li>
Before you start coding buy Web Database Applications with
PHP & MySQL by O'Reilly if you don't know php already.
Have a look at the mysqladmin command to create users
& my enter_databaseinfo to create scripts.
</li>
<li>
Thanks for implementing sajax my AJAX engine the clever stuff
I'm doing here is generating javascript from php & using
generic_cb to evaluate the javascript after the call.
</li>
<li>
Security notice
I use mysqlclean to avoid sql injection.
I use xss_encode & xss_decode to avoid cross site scripting.
All form evaluation is done server side no javascript rubbish.
</li>
<li>
Most php bugs get reported in /var/log/httpd/error_log
Fix the bug usually save the page & reload it is the usual
debug cycle just like basic on the old sinclair spectrum.
</li>
<li>
Get familiar with the source base by becoming a power user.
database_tables is what you think it is.
defines.php & config.php are the most important files in the source.
</li>
<li>
Look at pear.php.net I use a lot of this stuff the code runs
on fedora core 5 & 6 it is untested in 7.
</li>
<li>
Until google get involved with their open source mysql extensions
& google.travelsmart.ie .
The best place to host travelsmart I found is rosehosting.com
they cost around $30 a month.
