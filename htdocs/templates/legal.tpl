<p><b>Safety</b><br>
TravelSmart provides a service that enables you to contact and meet new people who may have similar transportation needs. TravelSmart cannot and does not ensure the lawful behavior of the people exchanging information through its web site. You take full responsibility for ensuring your personal safety when interacting with other people whom you meet through TravelSmart.

<p><b>Privacy</b><br>
TravelSmart only requests the minimal information necessary to perform automatic door-to-door carpool matching. TravelSmart only collects your information to provide you with a ride-sharing service. TravelSmart will not provide your information to anyone else, for any other purpose, unless we are lawfully compelled to do so by a legal authority. Please note the following specific privacy-related issues and features:
</p>
<p>
You must provide a working e-mail address. Because we allow other users to send you e-mails if they think you are a good match for their trip, we will only show your trip to other users if you have confirmed that your e-mail address is functional (we send a confirmation e-mail to that address and you must respond to it). For an added measure of privacy, if you desire, you can get yourself another e-mail address (many free e-mail services are available on other web sites) and use that e-mail address for your TravelSmart e-mail.
